## Git vs. GitHub
* **Git** is a version control system tool to manage your source code history; doesn't require Github. 
* **Github** store code in the cloud and visually track changes; requires Git.

**Github** is a website where you run **Git** and become into repositories or projects, while **Git** is a repository when you manage your codes.
